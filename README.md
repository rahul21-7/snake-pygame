run the `snake.exe` file in the `./dist` directory, this should directly start the game

you can collide with the walls, you will be teleported to the other side of the window in that case, you will lose the game if you try to eat yourself, the length of the snake will keep increasing as you eat more fruits

blue box is the fruit, red is the snake
